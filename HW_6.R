### Question 1

# H1 0: The body weight of the crabs is not correlated with the gill weight
# H1: The body weight of the crabs is positively correlated with the gill weight

### Question 2

# Lots of hypotheses possible, all follow these templates
# H0: The paramteter (___) is not correlated with the parameter (___)
# H: The paramteter (___) IS correlated with the parameter (___)

# this large matrix is an easy way to quickly pick out correlations, though it does not report p-values (must be done individually)
# See plot for significant correlations (denoted with " * ")
